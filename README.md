# ArdumowerDK
Bluetooth Serial Communication to Ardumower


#Dependencies:
	Win XP, Win Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 10, (Linux)
	
	Bluetooth Serial emulation *COM port installed (outgoing) 
		ArdumowerDK will scan all available comports and send {.},
		while listening to an "Ardumower" reply to determine if talking to Ardumower or not
		if no Ardumower is found some debug messages (kind of simulation mode) 
		will be sent to the program and the plot will automatically load and plot some data.
		No comport has to be set. 
		
	Python 2.7 32bit
		Pyserial
		Matplotlib

	 ',' or '|' or '{' or '}' should not be used in the debug strings 
	 since these characters are used for filtering normal communication (commands/plot data)
